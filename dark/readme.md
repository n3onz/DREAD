## Dark Net Virtual Machine

This VM will serve as our portal to the Dark Web. We will be able to run scripts on the Dark Net to get more valuable data from our .onion link list. We want to be able to ping these .onion links, pull HTML from the links and parse for text against a word list, and pull image meta-deta.

## Tasks prior to set up

- Get the VM up and running and paritioned on its section of our network
- Devise a way to push info from Aquamentus to the VM
- Devise a way to push infrom from our VM to our web server
- Install modules and programs to be able to process the scripts from last year on our VM

## Goals for next phase
- World list complete for parsing text
- Parsing script complete
- Pinging script complete and automated
- Planning phase for image meta-deta
